# Welcome to the astro.com Content Style Guide (Preamble)

This style guide was created by Ru-Ping Chen (rupingchen.github.io) for astro.com, but she hopes it'll also help other astrology-based organizations and companies too.

## If you work at astro.com

This is not your formal company style guide. Ru-Ping created it to identify user experience problems with astro.com. 

Don't let the spelling of Ru-Ping's name fool you! She's a native speaker of English (and Mandarin Chinese and Mandarin dialects). She promises that this guide will help you write clear, consistent, and mindful content. Feel free to use it as a reference, but don't forget to credit Ru-Ping!

This guide goes beyond standard astrological practices because Ru-Ping believes astrological content should find a new manner of expression. If you have problems with this, contact Ru-Ping directly. She's willing to have civilized discussions about these issues! rupingchen.github.io has her contact information.

Ru-Ping has chosen to provide a simple and structured guide, as she can achieve only so much as one person. If you want to add more content to this guide, contact Ru-Ping directly. Or submit an issue on GitHub.

This guide is completely searachable. 

Ru-Ping adapted this guide from the Mailchimp Content Style Guide. Thanks Mailchimp!
