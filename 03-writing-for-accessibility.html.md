# Writing for Accessibility

Astro.com, as it currently exists, provides content that lacks accessibility. Standard organizational hierarchy is largely absent and prevents us from achieving our goals to inform and guide users who want to learn more about astrology. Remember, accessibility includes users of all mental and physical capacities.

## Guidelines

### Avoid generalizations 

Avoid language that makes it easy to jump to conclusions and make generalizations. Too often, beginners get caught in black-and-white interpretations of astrological thought and we want to avoid that. 

- Yes: “A stellium in the 12th house indicates that dealing with and identifying subconscious motivations behind your decisions will likely play a significant role in your life.”
- No: “A stellium in the 12th house means you'll always be miserable.”

### Use headers

Headers should always be nested and consecutive. Avoid excessive nesting.

### Employ a hierarchy

Put the most important information first. Place similar topics in the same paragraph, and clearly separate different topics with headings.

### Change the type of language you use depending on who your audience is

If you're writing for beginners, don't inundate your posts with advanced astrological jardon like "ephemeris." If you need to include jargon, make sure to write clear and concise definitions. 

If you're writing for amateurs/experts, we encourage the inclusion of jargon. When your audience bears about the same level of understanding as you do, jargon encourages in-depth discussions and contributes to development of astrological craft.

### Use alt text

The alt tag is the most basic form of image description, and it should be included on all images. The language will depend on the purpose of the image:

- If it’s a creative photo or supports a story, describe the image in detail in a brief caption.
- If the image is serving a specific function, describe what’s inside the image in detail. People who don’t see the image should come away with the same information as if they had.
- If you’re sharing a chart or graph, include the data in the alt text so people have all the important information.

Each browser handles alt tags differently. Supplement images with standard captions when possible.
