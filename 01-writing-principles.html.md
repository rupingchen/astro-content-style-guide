# Writing Goals and Principles

With every piece of astrological content that astro.com publishes, astro.com should aim to:

* **Guide.** Use language that teaches users how to interpret astrology in an emotionally healthy manner.

* **Inform.** Don't lecture your readers. Remember that these people have a vested interest in learning more about astrology and we don't want to destroy that interest. Be considerate and instructive, but don't patronize.

* **Give astrology a different voice.** Astrologers present information in one of two extremes: (1) quirky, relatable content and (2) scientific-like language. We want to find the happy medium. See [astrolocherry](https://astrolocherry.com/) for examples.

* **Avoid absolutes.** Astrology has a negative reputation for dealing in absolutes and let's face it. We know that just isn't the case. Make sure to point out that astrology deals in the gray areas of the human experience, not in the black-and-white.

* **Include information that applies to people of all walks of life.** Many astrologers tend to create content only for Western audiences and for all intents and purposes, that shouldn't be the case. It's the 21st century and we need to get with the times.

* **Evolve.** As the world becomes more connected, we need to acknowledge the existence of non-Western astrological practices. But remember, though we should aim learn from each, we need to be mindful in how we present information. Give credit where credit is due and if you don't know what to do, get a second opinion. Most importantly, follow your gut. If it doesn't feel right, don't do it. 

So in order to achieve these goals, astro.com should make sure that content is:

* **Clear.** Use simple words and sentences. Keep in mind that beginners will also read your content. 

* **Unbiased.** Make sure to present information in an unbiased manner. Astrology may not be a science, but we should write content that provides users with a good foundation, so they can come to their own conclusions as they learn more.

* **Quirky.** Astrology is about the human experience, so don't be afraid to sound relatable.

* **Mindful and Inclusive.** Do not use astrology to make generalizations about other groups of people. It's simple. And in the 21st century, this should be a given.
