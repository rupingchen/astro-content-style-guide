# Voice and Tone

One way we write mindful and inclusive content is by being aware of our voice and our tone.

What’s the difference between voice and tone (as it relates to astrology)? Think of it this way: the sound of your voice is likely dictated by your Mercury placements, but the tone changes depending on your mood. For example, when you get angry, the tone of your angry voice is influenced by your Mars placements.

The same is true for astro.com. The sounds of our voices might generally be the same, but tone-changes are situation-dependent.

## Voice

Astro.com publishes a variety of content: from natal chart reports to informational articles, navigation of our site can be quite difficult. That's why we speak like a quirky professor who knows everything about anything, just so we don't bore our users. We're brimming with information, like a walking encyclopedia, and an edge of spirituality, like Buddhist teachings.

Most importantly, we treat every enthusiastic learner seriously. We want to teach people how to use astrology in an emotionally healthy manner, without confusing or overwhelming them.  

And by mixing formal and spiritual language, we experiment with language to create something new, to give astrologers a novel user experience. Add a dash of humor and you're set!  

All of this means that when we write copy:

1. **We are mindful.** We understand the struggles our users face: confusing astrological jargon, rigid interpretations, and little guidance. We adjust the way we present material by being culturally and racially mindful, and value unbiased information above all. Because astro.com serves astrologers of all kinds, we avoid catering only to one group. We include all. 

2. **We are teachers.** We take our responsibilities seriously by providing guidance and encouragement to students of astrology. We do not patronize. 

3. **We are translators.** We know astrology can be nebulous and hard to understand. That's why it's our job to uncomplicate how astrological information is typically presented. 

## Tone

Astro.com's tone is usually formal, but we're trying to change that. Don't be afraid to have a litte fun and entertain! However, remember to consider your audience members and their states of mind. Are they beginners or experts? Do they know how to read natal charts? Once you can adequately answer these questions (among others), change your tone accordingly. 


## Style tips

* **Active voice** Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.
* **Write objectively for informational pieces** Use formal and unbiased language.
* **Write humorously/entertainingly every now and then** It's okay to have fun, especially when providing examples for an informational piece.
