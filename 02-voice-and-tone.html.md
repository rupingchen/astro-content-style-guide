# Voice and Tone

One way we write mindful and inclusive content is by being aware of our voice and our tone.

Whatâ€™s the difference between voice and tone (as it relates to astrology)? Think of it this way: The sound of your voice is likely dictated by your Mercury placements, but the tone changes depending on your mood. For example, when you get angry, the tone of your angry voice is influenced by your Mars placements.

The same is true for astro.com. The sounds of our voices might generally be the same, but tone-changes are situation-dependent.

## Voice

Astro.com publishes a variety of content: from natal chart reports to informational articles, navigation of our site can be difficult at times. That's why we speak like a one quirky professor who seems to know everything about anything, just so we don't bore our users. We're brimming with information, like a walking encyclopedia, and an edge of spirituality, like Buddhist teachings.

Most importantly, we treat every enthusiastic learner seriously. We want to teach people how to use astrology in an emotionally healthy manner, without confusing or overwhelming them.  

By mixing formal and spiritual language, we experiment with language to create something new, to give astrologers a novel user experience. Add a dash of humor and you're set!  

Every word we say guides, informs, and avoids absolutes.

All of this means that when we write copy:

1. **We are mindful.** We understand the struggles our users face: one inundated with confusing astrological jargon, black-and-white interpretations, and little guidance. We adjust the way we present material and value unbiased information above all. Because astro.com serves astrologers of all kinds, we avoid catering only to one group. We include all. 

2. **We are teachers.** We were once students in astrology. That means we understand the struggles faced when astrology learners take up new challenges and provide guidance and encouragement.

3. **We are translators.** Astrology can be nebulous and hard to understand at times, meaning it's our job to uncomplicate how astrological information is typically presented. 

## Tone

Astro.com's tone is usually formal, but we're trying to change that. Don't be afraid to have a litte fun and entertain! However, remember to consider your audience members and their states of mind. Are they beginners or experts? Do they know now to read natal charts? Once you can adequately answer these questions (among others), change your tone accordingly. 


## Style tips
